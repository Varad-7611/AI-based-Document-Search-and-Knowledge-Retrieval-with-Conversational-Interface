# 📄 AI Based Document Search and Knowledge Retrieval with Conversational Interface

An AI-powered document search and conversational question-answering system that enables users to upload documents and interact with them through a chat-based interface. The system uses semantic search and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ensure accurate, context-aware responses strictly based on the uploaded content.

## 🚀 Features

- Upload and process multiple **PDF** and **TXT** documents  
- Semantic search using vector embeddings  
- Conversational question-answering interface  
- Answers restricted strictly to document context 
- OCR fallback for scanned or image-based PDFs  
- Modern dark UI with smooth hover effects  
- Fast and efficient vector search using **ChromaDB**  
- Modular and scalable architecture

## ⚙️ Installation

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

## 🧪 How It Works

1. User uploads **PDF** or **TXT** documents  
2. Text is extracted using **PyPDF2** (with OCR fallback for scanned PDFs)  
3. Text is split into smaller chunks  
4. Vector embeddings are generated using **MiniLM**  
5. Embeddings are stored in **ChromaDB**  
6. Relevant chunks are retrieved for each user query  
7. The **LLaMA** model generates a response strictly from the retrieved context  

---

## 💬 Usage

1. Upload one or more documents  
2. Click **Process Documents**  
3. Ask questions using the chat input  
4. Receive accurate answers based only on document content  

If the answer is not found in the documents, the system responds with:

> **"I don't know"**
